# Get the short/long Git version hashes

### Get last commit short version hash

* ```git rev-parse --short HEAD```
* ```git log -1 --pretty=format:%h```
* ```git branch -v``` - This is very useful to compare local branches commit hashes
* ```git branch -av``` - or include remote branches too
* ```git log -1 --abbrev-commit``` - details about last commit
* ```git log --oneline``` - full list of commits and short commit hash
